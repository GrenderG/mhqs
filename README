This Python script will run a HTTP proxy server capable to serving content to
Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the Nintendo 3DS.

You can report issues, get the latest version, and view the source at:
  http://github.com/svanheulen/mhqs

These scripts work with Python 2.x only

They also require the Twisted module:
  https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

And my mhef module:
  https://github.com/svanheulen/mhef

View the command line help like this:
  python mh4u_proxy.py -h

The quest files that you provide to the script must be decrypted (and valid).
The script will build all the files you need, encrypt them and keep them in a
temporary folder until it is closed. Keep in mind that it will use the quest ID
from inside the quest file, so make sure to change it to something different
for each of your quests. The names of the quest files are irrelevant. Also note
that the proxy runs on port 8080, so be sure to set it correctly in your proxy
settings on your 3DS.

For information on the quest file format see this page:
