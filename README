You need to create a folder called 'quests' in the same folder as the
server.py file and put the quest files in there. Then run the
server.py file using Python 2.x to start the server.

Once you have the server running you can access it from Monster Hunter
Portable 3rd even with OFW on your PSP. Just create a new network
configuration on your PSP and set up the proxy setting to point to the
machine running this server. Within Monster Hunter go to the download
section and use the new network configuration to view your quest
server.
